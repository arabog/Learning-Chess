2. Playing the game:
N.B: Before mking any capture always check if the piece(e) is
protected.

1. Moving and Capturing:
A great strategy to help win chess games is to capture opposing 
pieces. Most captures are made the same way that pieces normally 
move, but pawns capture diagonally.


2. Check
Check means that a king is being threatened. A king can never 
actually be captured, so the other side must get out of check 
by moving, blocking, or capturing the checking piece.



3. Getting Out of Check
When you are in check you must escape. The ways to get out of 
check are to move the king, block the check with another piece, 
or capture the checking piece.


4. Checkmate
You win when your opponent is in check and cannot escape. That 
is called checkmate!

backrank checkmate???


5. Fastest Checkmate
Chess games can last many moves, but a series of weak moves by 
one side can result in a very fast checkmate.

White       Black
pawn f3      pawn e5

pawn g4      queen h4  checkmate

Or:

White       Black
pawn e4     pawn f6

pawn d4     pawn g5

queen h5 checkmate



6. Stalemate
Stalemate occurs when there are no possible moves, but neither 
king is in check. Stalemate is a draw, even if one of the players 
has many more pieces on the board.

N.B: To prevent stalemate smtimes, you may need to give the king
some breathing space and reinforce by making the most closest pawn
that can be converted to become another queen.


7. Other Draws
Chess games can end in draws because of stalemate, an agreement between 
the players, three repetitions of the same position, or 50 moves without 
a pawn move or a capture.

N.B: 
1. A king and a bishop cannot create a checkmate without other pieces, 
so the game is a draw.

2. Black's king must return to g8 and White can repeat the position, g6, 
with queen checks until the game is drawn.

3. White promotes to a queen, forcing the king to capture the queen 
and leave the rook unprotected. 


8. Castling
The king may move two squares to either side, with the rook moving to 
the other side of the king. Not legal if either piece has moved or if 
the king would move into, out of, or through check.

For castling to work, it must be d 1st move for both the king and the
rook.

This move blocks the check, but now Black's bishop can capture the far 
more valuable queen. Try blocking with a less valuable piece (e.g pawn) 
than the queen.

Castling can be on the queenside or kingside.

White can't castle (on d queenside) right now because the king would 
castle directly into a check from Black's bishop. 


9. En Passant (In Passing)
There is one weird pawn move where a pawn makes its first move up two 
squares and can be captured! 


Black just moved the e-pawn two squares on its first turn to the 
e5-square. Can you use en passant to capture the pawn by moving 
your pawn to e6?

Black's pawn advances two squares for its first move of the game. 
Is en passant the best move for White, or is there another way 
to capture this pawn that is better?


10. The Language of Chess
Every square in chess has a name, with vertical files from a-h 
horizontal ranks from 1-8. Each move is written with a letter 
for the piece and the square it moves to. Watch the video for 
more.

Ke2 means King moves to square e2.
pawn are written with d square name e.g. e4

N.B:
White can move two pieces to d8.

White can move two knights to e4. Play the knight from the 
g-file to e4, which is Nge4.


11. Finding the Right Move
At each turn you will want to consider your option and your 
opponent's options. You'll want to pay particular attention 
to checks, captures and threats.

Shd i move a piece or capture a piece?

N.B: 
Wn you find a good move, always find a better/best move.
It takes time and practice to find the best move.

Checkmate is worth more than a queen.

White's bishop captures the unprotected pawn, and now attacks 
Black's rook which is completely trapped!
