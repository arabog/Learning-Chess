2. Playing the game:

1. Moving and Capturing:
A great strategy to help win chess games is to capture opposing 
pieces. Most captures are made the same way that pieces normally 
move, but pawns capture diagonally.


2. Check
Check means that a king is being threatened. A king can never 
actually be captured, so the other side must get out of check 
by moving, blocking, or capturing the checking piece.



3. Getting Out of Check
When you are in check you must escape. The ways to get out of 
check are to move the king, block the check with another piece, 
or capture the checking piece.


4. Checkmate
You win when your opponent is in check and cannot escape. That 
is called checkmate!


5. Fastest Checkmate
Chess games can last many moves, but a series of weak moves by 
one side can result in a very fast checkmate.

White       Black
pawn f3      pawn e5

pawn g4      queen h4  checkmate

Or:

White       Black
pawn e4     pawn f6

pawn d4     pawn g5

queen h5 checkmate



6. Stalemate
Stalemate occurs when there are no possible moves, but neither 
king is in check. Stalemate is a draw, even if one of the players 
has many more pieces on the board.

N.B: To prevent stalemate smtimes, you may need to give the king
some breathing space and reinforce by making the most closest pawn
that can be converted to become another queen.


7. Other Draws
Chess games can end in draws because of stalemate, an agreement between 
the players, three repetitions of the same position, or 50 moves without 
a pawn move or a capture.

N.B: A king and a bishop cannot create a checkmate without other pieces, 
so the game is a draw.
