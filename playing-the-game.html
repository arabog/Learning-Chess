1. Moving and Capturing:
A great strategy to help win chess games is to capture opposing 
pieces. Most captures are made the same way that pieces normally 
move, but pawns capture diagonally.


2. Check
Check means that a king is being threatened. A king can never actually be captured, so the other side must get out of check by moving, blocking, or capturing the checking piece.
