<!-- 
CHESS:
It is played on an 8 by 8 board with 64 squares and 32 pieces


1. King:
Can move a square at a time.

Chess is won by checkmating - trapping - the opponent’s king. 
The king can move to any square that’s directly next to it: up, 
down, sideways, or diagonal.


2. Queen:
It is the most important piece.
The queen can move forwards, backward, sideways, and diagonally 
like a king. However, unlike the king, the queen can move as far 
as it wants to in each of these directions.
