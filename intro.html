It is played on an 8 by 8 board with 64 squares and 32 pieces

N.B: Divide the board into 4 places of 8 each.

        A Chess board:
    8   *   *   *   *    |   *   *   *   *   
    7   *   *   *   *    |   *   *   *   *   
    6   *   *   *   *    |   *   *   *   *   
    5   *   *   *   *    |   *   *   *   *   

        =   =   =   =   ===  =  =   =   =   

    4   *   *   *   *    |   *   *   *   *   
    3   *   *   *   *    |   *   *   *   *   
    2   *   *   *   *    |   *   *   *   *

Where is the 1st rank?
The columns of a chessboard are known as files, the rows 
are known as ranks 


A. How to Move the Pieces

1. The King: 
It is the most important piece and can move a square at a time.

Chess is won by checkmating - trapping - the opponent’s king. 
The king can move to any square that’s directly next to it: 
up, down, sideways, or diagonal.


2. The Queen:
It is the most powerful piece.

The queen can move forwards, backward, sideways, and diagonally 
like a king. However, unlike the king, the queen can move as far 
as it wants to in each of these directions.


3. The Rook:
Is the second most powerful piece. 
The rook can move forwards, backward, and sideways in a straigt
line.


4. The Bishop:
The bishop can move diagonally like a queen, but not forward, 
backward, or sideways. Each side starts with two bishops, one 
on a light square and one on a dark square.

The light square bishop can only move on the light-squared
diagonally while the dark-squared bishop can move on the dark 
squares diagonally.

Both with a single move can enters into the longest dark/light
diagonal on the board.


5. The Knight:
The knight is the only chess piece that doesn't go in a straight 
line. 

The knight moves two squares in one direction and then turns and 
goes one square to the side.

It moves in L shape and is the only piece that can jump over 
other pieces.

If it starts from a light square, it moves to a dark square
then to a light sqaure and so on.


6. The Pawn:
It is one of the most powerful pieces.

It is the soul of chess.

Pawns move one square forward and cannot move back. A pawn may 
advance two squares on its first move. Pawns can only capture 
one square diagonally ahead.

When a pawn reaches the end of the board it “promotes”, it turns 
into another piece. Most of the time players promote to a queen, 
but a rook, knight, or bishop is also possible.


Scenerios:
White has two pawns. Which one can you promote quickly so that 
Black's king won't capture it?


7. Setting Up the Board:
Rooks are in the corners, with knights next to them, followed 
by bishops. Kings and queens take the center squares with the 
queen on her own color. All pawns go on the 2nd and 7th ranks.

N.B: White square must be on the right wn arranging d pieces.


8. Moving and Capturing:
A great strategy to help win chess games is to capture opposing 
pieces. Most captures are made the same way that pieces normally 
move, but pawns capture diagonally.
