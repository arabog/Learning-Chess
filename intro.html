CHESS:
It is played on an 8 by 8 board with 64 squares and 32 pieces

N.B: Divide the board into 4 places of 8 each.

Que:
Where is the 1st rank?

1. The King: 
It is the most important piece and can move a square at a time.

Chess is won by checkmating - trapping - the opponent’s king. 
The king can move to any square that’s directly next to it: up, 
down, sideways, or diagonal.


2. The Queen:
It is the most powerful piece.
The queen can move forwards, backward, sideways, and diagonally 
like a king. However, unlike the king, the queen can move as far 
as it wants to in each of these directions.


3. The Rook:
Is the second most powerful piece. 
The rook can move forwards, backward, and sideways in a straign
line.


4. The Bishop:
The bishop can move diagonally like a queen, but not forward, 
backward, or sideways. Each side starts with two bishops, one 
on a light square and one on a dark square.

The light square bishop can only move on the light-squared
diagonally while the dark-squared bishop can move on the dark 
squares diagonally.

Both with a single move can enters into the longest dark/light
diagonal on the board.


5. The Knight:
The knight is the only chess piece that doesn't go in a straight 
line. 
The knight moves two squares in one direction and then turns and 
goes one square to the side.

It moves in L shape and is the only piece that can jump over 
other pieces.
