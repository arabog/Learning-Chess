1. The King: 
It is the most important piece and can move a square at a time.

The king can move to any square that’s directly next to it: up, 
down, sideways, or diagonal.


2. The Queen:
It is the most powerful piece.
The queen can move forwards, backward, sideways, and diagonally 
like a king. However, unlike the king, the queen can move as far 
as it wants to in each of these directions.
