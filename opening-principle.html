1. Control d center:
Put your pieces in the ideal position to control the 
most important part of the board - the center.

d centre of the board are: d4, e4, e5 and d5.

Knight is weak wn it is at d end of the board.

We do not want to allow White to have two pawns in the 
center. Can you find a strong capture that removes one 
of White's pawns from the center?
Capture one of the pawn.

How can White grab control of the center by putting a 
pawn directly in the middle of the board?
e2 to e4

There's a better move. Try again and look for a strong 
way to attack Black's knight with a pawn.

It's better to use a center pawn to attack the knight 
(on e4).


2. Develop your pieces:
Take control of the game by developing your pieces rapidly 
to squares where they control the center.

Think about d board without the pieces.

inner center: the chess mountains
d4, e4, e5 and d5 r d chest mountain i.e. d most impt 
squares.

outer center: the chess hills
c3, c4, c5, c6
d3 d6
e3, e6
f3, f4, f5, f6


the white bishop on white square most active diagonal 
is c4.

White is threatening to capture our pawn on e5 using Kf3. 
How can Black best develop a piece toward the center and 
protect this pawn?

d6 is an alternative:
This is a reasonable, but passive defensive move as it blocks 
Black's dark-squared bishop from entering the action in the 
center. Let's find a more natural knight move which protects 
the e5 pawn. Nc6 is correct

Try most times to develop your pieces to safe, active squares!

Let's use our superior development and threaten checkmate on 
f7! using a Bc4 and Kg5.

Your best move to a potential checkmate may be a strong pawn 
move which blocks one of the pieces for checkmate.
