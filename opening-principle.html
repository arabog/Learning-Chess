Put your pieces in the ideal position to control the 
most important part of the board - the center.

d centre of the board are: d4, e4, e5 and d5.

Knight is weak wn it is at d end of the board.

We do not want to allow White to have two pawns in the 
center. Can you find a strong capture that removes one 
of White's pawns from the center?
Capture one of the pawn.

How can White grab control of the center by putting a 
pawn directly in the middle of the board?

There's a better move. Try again and look for a strong 
way to attack Black's knight with a pawn.
