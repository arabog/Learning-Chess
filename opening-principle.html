1. Control d center:
Put your pieces in the ideal position to control the 
most important part of the board - the center.

d centre of the board are: d4, e4, e5 and d5.

N.B:
Knight is weak wn it is at d end of the board.

We do not want to allow White to have two pawns in the 
center. Can you find a strong capture that removes one 
of White's pawns from the center?
Capture one of the pawn at d centre: d4, e4, e5 or d5.

How can White grab control of the center by putting a 
pawn directly in the middle of the board?
e2 to e4

N.B:
There's a better move. Try again and look for a strong 
way to attack Black's knight with a pawn.

It's better to use a center pawn to attack the knight 
(on e4).

Always look for a better. 
Make this a practise, the 1st easy move or d 1st ready
available move is nt d d better/best move.


2. Develop your pieces:
Take control of the game by developing your pieces rapidly 
to squares where they control the center.

Think about d board without the pieces.

inner center: the chess mountains
d4, e4, e5 and d5 r d most impt squares of d chess board.

outer center: the chess hills
c3, c4, c5, c6
d3 d6
e3, e6
f3, f4, f5, f6

N.B:
the white bishop, on white square, most active diagonal
position is c4.

White is threatening to capture our pawn on e5 using Kf3. 
How can Black best develop a piece toward the center and 
protect this pawn?

d6 is an alternative:
This is a reasonable, but passive defensive move as it blocks 
Black's dark-squared bishop from entering the action in the 
center. Let's find a more natural knight move which protects 
the e5 pawn. Nc6 is correct

N.B:
Make sure nt to block ur vital pieces by urself.

Try most times to develop your pieces to safe, active squares!

Let's use our superior development and threaten checkmate on 
f7! using a Bc4 and Kg5.

Your best move to a potential checkmate may be a strong pawn 
move which blocks one of the pieces for checkmate.

Or:

A threat to one of the combined checkmate pieces.
First, to one with restricted moves e.g bishop
and then to Second, with many moves, e.g a queen.


3. Protect your king:
Usually the best way to secure your king is to castle.

Castle early and castle often.

Think of castling as building a house for your king.
It also helps bring d rook to d game.


4. Active pieces:
An active piece has the potential to make many moves. 
The best way to get pieces active is to move them 
towards the center of the board.

N.B:
Dont expect ur opponent to mk blunders. This will not
make you gd nor win many games.
You win by using sound strategies and mking ur positns
better until u av an overwhelming advantage or ur 
opponent cant handle d pressure and crack.

Active positns:
e4, Kf3, Bc4, casting to king side, Re1


Qb5 is incorrect
You have the right idea, but can you activate a piece 
that hasn't moved yet to the same diagonal? Ba6


White wants to capture Black's pawn on c3 - which capture 
best activates a piece?
bxc3 is incorrect
Nice try, but the pawn on c3 blocks the knight on b1 from 
its most active square. Try again!

Nxc3 is correct
White captures the pawn and makes the knight an active 
piece fighting for the center!


5. Phases of the game:
Chess games typically feature three phases, the opening, the 
middlegame and the endgame. 

3 main goals of d opening:
1. Estb ctrl of d center: 
d4, e4, e5 and d5 r d most impt squares of d chess board.

2. Get ur pieces (d rooks, bishops) on d active squares:
c3, c4, c5, c6
d3 d6
e3, e6
f3, f4, f5, f6

3. Get ur king to safety by castling so d king is nt exposed
to the danger of the battle in d centre.

N.B: All ur opening moves shd support dse goals.

e4 moves a pawn directly into the center. After Black gains 
space in the center with 1...e5, can you develop a piece 
toward the center and attack Black's center?
Nf3 is correct
White develops the knight toward the center and threatens 
to capture Black's pawn on e5.
