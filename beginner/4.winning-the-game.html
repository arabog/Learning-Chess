Winning The Game:


1. The 4-Move Checkmate
The four-move checkmate is a common way to win at the beginner level. 
White moves:
1. e4 e5 
2. Qh5/Qf3 Nc6 
3. Bc4 with Qxf7# 

Black can stop it by blocking the white queen from reaching f7, wc
is only protected by d king.

How black could have avoided this:
White           Black
e4              e5
Bc4             Kc6
Qh5             g6 (soln)

g6 blks f7 and attacks d queen one of the checkmate combo.

Qf3             Kf6

At Qh5, queen is attacking both f7 and e5 pawns.
Depending on if Bc4 has also being developed, if it's not
protect e5 with Kc6 and wn Bc4 is developed, protect f7 
by attacking Qh5 with g6.
