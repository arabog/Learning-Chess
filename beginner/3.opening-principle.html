1. Control d center:
Put your pieces in the ideal position to control the most 
important part of the board - the center.

d centre of the board are: d4, d5, e4, and e5.

a.
Knight is weak wn it is at d ends of the board.

b.
We do not want to allow White to have two pawns in the center. 

c.
Can you find a strong capture that removes one of White's pawns 
from the center?
Capture one of the pawn at d centre: d4, d5, e4, or e5.

d.
How can White grab control of the center by putting a pawn 
directly in the middle of the board?
Play e2 to e4

e.
There's always a better move. Try again and look for a strong 
way to attack Black's knight with a pawn.
It's better to use a center pawn to attack the knight (on e4).

f.
Always look for a better move. 
Make this a practise, the 1st easy move or d 1st readily 
available move is nt d d better/best move.


2. Develop your pieces:
Take control of the game by developing your pieces rapidly to 
squares where they control the center.

a.
Think about d board without the pieces.

inner center: the chess mountains
d4, d5, e4, and e5 r d most impt squares of d chess board.

outer center: the chess hills
c3, c4, c5, c6
d3, d6
e3, e6
f3, f4, f5, f6

b.
The white bishop, on white square, most active diagonal 
position is c4.

c.
White is threatening to capture our pawn on e5 using Kf3. 
How can Black best develop a piece toward the center and 
protect this pawn?

d6 is an alternative:
This is a reasonable, but passive defensive move as it blocks 
Black's dark-squared bishop from entering the action in the 
center. Let's find a more natural knight move which protects 
the e5 pawn. 
Nc6 is correct

d.
Make sure nt to block ur vital pieces by urself.

e.
Try most times to develop your pieces to safe, active squares!

f.
Let's use our superior development and threaten checkmate on 
f7! using a Bc4 (from Bf1) and Kg5 (from Kf3).

e.
Your best move to prevent a potential checkmate may be a strong 
pawn move which blocks one of the pieces for checkmate.

Or:

A threat to one of the combined checkmate pieces.
First, to one with restricted moves e.g bishop and then 
Secondly, to d piece with many moves, e.g a queen.


3. Protect your king:
Usually the best way to secure your king is to castle.

a.
Castle early and castle often.

b.
Think of castling as building a house for your king.
It also helps bring d rook to d game.


4. Active pieces:
An active piece has the potential to make many moves. 
The best way to get pieces active is to move them 
towards the center of the board.

a.
Dont expect ur opponent to mk blunders. This will not
make you gd nor win many games.

b.
You win by using sound strategies and mking ur positns
(mountain and hill positions) better until u av an 
overwhelming advantage or ur opponent cant handle d 
pressure and crack.

c.
Active positns:
e4, Kf3, Bc4, casting to king side, Re1

d.
Can you find a developing move for Black that prevents White 
from castling?

Qb5 is incorrect
You have the right idea, but can you activate a piece that hasn't 
moved yet to the same diagonal?

Ba6 is correct
Black's bishop enjoys an open diagonal and prevents White from castling.

e.
White wants to capture Black's pawn on c3 - which capture 
best activates a piece?

Nxc3 is correct
White captures the pawn and makes the knight an active 
piece fighting for the center!

f.
White wants to develop the light-squared bishop. What is the best square for this bishop?

d3 is incorrect
When activating a piece, don't forget to keep your other pieces safe. Try again!

e2
is correct
Good job! The bishop enjoys open squares on the d1-h5 diagonal and prepares castling on the next move.

g.

h. 
How can Black develop a piece and block White's rook from attacking the dark-squared bishop on e7
dt also has d queen on e1?

Kg8
is incorrect
This move does not block White's rook from attacking the bishop on e7. Try again!

Black activates the light-squared bishop and is ready to castle. White now activates the bishop and threatens to capture the c7 pawn. How can Black bring the king to safety and protect the c7 pawn in a single move?

Black moves the king to safety, protects the c7 pawn, and activates a rook on the d-file with a single move!

i.
Black's rook is ready to invade on e1 or e2. How can you prevent both these moves and activate White's rook on Rb1?
Kd2
is correct
The king is an active piece! White prevents the Black rook from invading and opens up the first-rank for White's rook. Great job!

5. Phases of the game:
Chess games typically feature three phases, the opening, the 
middlegame and the endgame. 

3 main goals of d opening:
1. Estb ctrl of d center: 
d4, e4, e5 and d5 r d most impt squares of d chess board.

2. Get ur pieces (d rooks, bishops) on d active squares:
c3, c4, c5, c6
d3 d6
e3, e6
f3, f4, f5, f6

3. Get ur king to safety by castling so d king is nt exposed
to the danger of the battle in d centre.

N.B: All ur opening moves shd support dse goals.
